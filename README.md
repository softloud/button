  PRESS A BUTTON NOW
==================================================

Explore the lived experience of working in data.

Press a button now to enter the world of data: → (press right arrow) ✓

You begin your career in data.


==================================================
  WELCOME!
==================================================

Welcome employee #LV-426-eILaSiekaCehT to your first day at TechCo! You are a
data scientist. It is your job to press buttons.

Press a button now to proceed to onboarding: → (press right arrow) ✓

You proceed to onboarding.


==================================================
  ONBOARDING
==================================================

Welcome employee  #LV-426-eILaSiekaCehT  to onboarding at TechCo! You are a data
scientist. It is your job to press buttons.

Press a button now to complete onboarding: → (press right arrow) ✓

Well done for completing onboarding. Your button-pressing mastery qualifies you
to begin consulting with TechCo stakeholders!


==================================================
  A QUESTION THAT NEEDS ANSWERING
==================================================

An executive at TechCo has a question that needs answering. You are told the
data can be found in the data warehouse, no problem. Once you are done with the
anlaysis, there will be cake.

Press a button now to consult stakeholders about their evidence-based needs: →
(press right arrow) ✓

With a question defined by the stakeholder, you are ready to source the data.
Leadership promise there will be cake after the analysis presentation.


==================================================
  SOURCE THE DATA
==================================================

The data warehouse is home to hundreds of databases. Each database is home to
dozens of tables, each of which has hundreds of columns. There are billions of
rows of data.

Press a button now to dive into the warehouse and live in matrix-scroll land of
scrutinising seemingly endless columns and rows: → (press right arrow) ✓

You find clearly-marked tables with interpretable column names.


==================================================
  SHAPE THE DATA
==================================================

Now that you have figured out which data sources you need to extract from, you
are ready to transform the data into analytic tables that will form the
foundation of your shiny analyses. You are sure looking forward to that cake.

Press a button now to architect a data lineage: → (press right arrow) ✓

You architect a clean data lineage that pulls the sources together into datasets
ready for analysis.


==================================================
  ANALYSE THE DATA
==================================================

Finally, the fun part! Making pretty pictures out of data to answering questions
in meaningful ways. Spurred on by the promise of cake, you lose yourself in the
finesse of choosing colour palettes and developing visualisations that answer
the multi-faceted question that was posed. You work late into the night.

Press a button now to build interactive data visualisations: → (press right
arrow) ✓

This step went as expected. You build dashboards that answer the question the
stakeholder framed.


==================================================
  REPORT YOUR FINDINGS
==================================================

The big day has arrived! The boardroom is filled with middle-managers somewhat
awfully assembled around croissants and tepid coffee. No cake yet, but getting
ever closer.

Press a button now to report your findings: → (press right arrow) ✓

This step went as expected. You present your findings with flair in the
boardroom to the stakeholders.


==================================================
  DECISION MAKER ASSESSMENT
==================================================

You receive a calendar invite from your manager saying they have met with
leadership and want to discuss how the analysis was received. There is no
mention of cake.

Press a button now to meet with your manager about the outcome of the analysis
and whether you will get cake: → (press right arrow) ✓

Oh, no! Something isn't quite right. When the analysis reaches leadership, they
state it doesn't answer the question posed. An abortive blame game erupts over
whether you misunderstood the question, your manager miscommunicated ir, or
whether leadership failed to make their actual needs known. The upshot it is,
you begin the analysis again.

Oh, no! Something isn't quite right. Your analysis shows duplicates and
missingness, empty bar plots, weird-looking scatter plots. Time to dive back
into the data lineage spaghetti and figure out what went wrong.

going to be any cake. You resignedly flicked you professional profile to
"available for work".
