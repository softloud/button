Press A Button Now - A Satirical Data Science Adventure Game
============================================================

A text-based adventure game that satirically explores the lived experience 
of working in data science. Players navigate through the typical data science 
workflow while experiencing the frustrations, loops, and unexpected turns 
that characterize real data work.

Game Features:
- Dynamic narrative sourced from Google Sheets
- Multiple game modes (production clean vs developer debug)
- Random decision points that mirror real data science uncertainty
- Comprehensive visualization of the narrative graph
- State tracking and journey summaries
- Consistent text wrapping and formatting for optimal console display

Architecture Overview:
- ButtonDf: Google Sheets data connector with retry logic
- ButtonDat: Game data aggregator and validator
- StoryGraph: NetworkX-based narrative visualization
- NodeEngine: Interactive game mechanics engine with text wrapping
- ButtonGame: Main game loop and state management

Usage:
    python -m button_1
