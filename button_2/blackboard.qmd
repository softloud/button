```{python }

from classes.data.button_dat import ButtonDat


```




```{python}
button_dat = ButtonDat()

```

Button dat should have an attribute that is edges.

```{python}
button_dat.edges_df


```

Button dat should has have nodes df.

```{python}
button_dat.nodes_df

```

## employee

Now to try employee, which takes button dat as input.

```{python}
from  classes.entities.employee import Employee

```


```{python}
employee = Employee(button_dat)

```

## text rendering

```{python}

from classes.text_gen.textgen_employee import EmployeeTextGenerator

# generate the text
employee_text = EmployeeTextGenerator(employee)

vars(employee_text)

```

```{python}
from classes.text_render.text_render_employee import EmployeeTextRenderer

employee_text_rendered = EmployeeTextRenderer(employee_text)

```

This is where I apply wrappers.

```{python}

employee_text_rendered.rendered_text

```
